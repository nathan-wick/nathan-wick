        What Is Programming?
    </div>
    <div
        className="text-small text-indent">
        Computer programming is the process of creating a set of <b>instructions</b> that tells a computer what to do. If you want to create something with a computer, you need to know how to program it.
    </div>
    <div
        className="text-small text-indent">
        These instructions are written in a <b>language</b> that the computer can understand, called a programming language. Some common programming languages include JavaScript, Python, and C++. Each programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses.

        Programmers use programming languages for:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Websites</b>: This includes everything from the design of the website to the functionality of the pages. For example, programming was used to create useful websites such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon.</li>
            <li><b>Video Games</b>: Programmers tell the computer how to display graphics, control the game's logic, and respond to player input. For example, programming was used to create fun games such as Minecraft, Fortnite, and the Sims.</li>
            <li><b>Data Science</b>: Programmers practice data science by writing code to collect, analyze, and visualize data. For example, programming was used to create ChatGPT, LaMDA, and DALL-E.</li>
            <li><b>Robotics</b>: Programmers create robots by writing code that tells the robot how to move, sense its surroundings, and interact with the world. For example, programming was used to create interesting robots such as Sophia, Boston Dynamics Atlas, and SpotMini.</li>
        </ul>
